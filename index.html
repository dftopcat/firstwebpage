            <br>At the same time I bought 745 of the pink flowers. My garden was home to many bees.🐝

<h1>This is the top heading for my first website, very exciting!</h1>
<h2>My sub-heading called H2. There are also smaller headings H3, H4, H5, etc.</h2>

<p>Hello World. Here it is, my first ever website using HTML, CSS and JS! Trying out new things can be (or not) lots of fun.
<br>
In this paragraph we can write anything. I like being creative🤔, talking to people and more and more with robots🤖...
<br>Taking photos is my hobby, though these have been plucked from the web. This red flower has been added using a URL link.
<br>The pink flower🌺 has been saved in the hard drive of my computer, as an image within the same folder as index.html.
