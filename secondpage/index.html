<p>Hello World. Here it is, my first ever website using HTML, CSS and JS! Trying out new things can be (or not) lots of fun.

In this paragraph we can write anything. I like being creative, talking to people and more and more with robots.
<br>Taking photos is my hobby, I am going to add a photo below. First from the web.
